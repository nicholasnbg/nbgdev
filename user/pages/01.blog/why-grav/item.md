Grav is a flat file based CMS (Content Management System). A file based CMS offers an alternative to the standard database-driven CMS platforms, such as Wordpress, Joomla and Magento. This means that data is stored in files and folders as opposed to in a database. Rather than pulling various data from different parts of a database, a flat file CMS typically relies on a combination of file names, header info, and templates to present pages and data.
