#Who Am I?#

Hi! I'm Nick, welcome to my blog.

A bit more about me...
- 26 years old from Melbourne Australia
- Devout, bleary eyed Tottenham Hotspur fan
- Born again coder

===

More on that last point. I began my journey down the coding wormhole in early 2016, when I took it upon myself to build an online store for my family's business. I had literally zero experience with anything code / wed development, *EVERYTHING* was new (think Codeacademy HTML course new).  

Shortly after, I discovered [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). I don't think I could ever thank [Quincy Larson](https://medium.com/@quincylarson) and the FreeCodeCamp team enough. After a few months, I had launched my online store, but more importantly, I had decided that *I am going to be a programmer*. For the first time in my professional life, I had direction, motivation, and a true passion (for something that wasn't watching my favorite sport teams or playing video games).

Since then I have been working hard at learning, creating, and growing as a developer. I've completed my Front End Certificate on FreeCodeCamp, been to many meetups and developer events in Melbourne, got my first free lance work, and even participated in my first Hackathon.


#What Is This?# 

What's this blog all about? A few things, mostly documenting my journey as a self taught developer, my travels and how I manage my learning throughout, and anything else I feel like talking about really.

In just under two weeks Carla (my better half) & I are heading off overseas, first spending 4 months working the snow season up at [Niseko, Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niseko,_Hokkaido), powder capital of the world. After that we plan to spend a few months travelling around South East Asia. I thought this blog would be a good way keep all my fans back home (hi Mum) updated throughout our trip, maybe try my hand at some photography / video editing.

Whilst travelling, I intend to continue learning and growing as a developer in a number of ways, such as:
- Creating and maintaining this blog, posting about what I am learning, and websites / articles I find interesting.
- Getting involved with some open source projects with people I have met through various meetups and forums
- Possibly attend a meetup or event while overseas (free food would be a bonus)
- Develop my own projects 

As much as this blog is somewhat self serving, a tool that will help me reinforce the knowledge I am constantly building upon, and the lessons I am learning, hopefully anyone reading it can take away something useful, whether it be travel inspiration, coding ideas, or having a laugh when I post a story about how it took me 5 hours of debugging to realise a misspelt word was breaking my entire app.

If you would like to get in touch with me about anything, feel free to [get in touch.](#)
