I've well and truly settled into unemployed life in Hirafu by this stage, and I although could definitely get used to waking up, taking a leisurely walk around town, swinging by the cafe for a coffee, then spending the afternoon relaxing and studying, before my housemates get home, I am actually looking forward to getting into the swing of work (getting paid), and of course, getting up on the hill for some snowboarding.

 Things I'm waiting for: 
 #### Work #
 I'm due to start on the 23rd (5 more days from today). I've actually had a change in my job. Originally I was to be a shuttle bus driver running a regular route from MnK's [Country Resort](http://mnkniseko.com/the-chalets-at-country-resort), but I was offered the concierge role at [Akazora](http://mnkniseko.com/akazora), which is more like a block of serviced apartments. Akazora is located very centrally compared to Country Resort, and should only be a 5 minute walk from our accommodation, and the role of concierge seems to come with more challenges, but is one that I'm looking forward to.

 My shifts will rotate between 7.30am - 4.30pm, 2.30pm - 10.30pm, and occasional split shifts (morning + night with a gap inbetween), so looks like I should have plenty of time to get up on the mountain.

 #### First Lifts #
 The first lift run is scheduled for the 23rd of Nov (same day that I start work unfortunately). Only the Grand Hirafu resort will be open ([see here](http://niseko.ne.jp/en/map/index.html)) initially, with the rest of the mountain to open up in the following few weeks. I'm also looking forward to some night skiing, which will begin on Dec 9, it is something I've never experienced before, and Niseko is meant to be one of the best places in the world for night skiing.

 #### To See The Top Of Hirafu #
 Although this morning was clear and sunny, there were still clouds surrounding the top of Mt Yotei. <a rel="lightbox" data-width="1280" data-height="800" href="/user/pages/images/sunny-hirafu-yotei.jpg">Still beautiful though.</a>

 #### North London Derby #
 One of the biggest games of Tottenham's season takes place tonight, the North London Derby, against Spurs North London rivals, Arsenal. I'd normally be a bit of a nervous wreck by this point, but have been pretty pre occupied. I'll be watching the game at home with a couple of gunner fans (gooners), as none of the sports bars have opened up for the season yet. 4-0 to Spurs with a Harry Kane hat trick and a goal to Vertonghen. COYS!
