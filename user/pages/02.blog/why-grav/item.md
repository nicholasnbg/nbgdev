<h3>What Is Grav?</h3>

Grav is a flat file based content management system(FFCMS for short). A file based CMS offers an alternative to the standard database-driven CMS platforms, such as Wordpress, Joomla and Magento. This means that data is stored in files and folders as opposed to in a database. Rather than pulling various data from different parts of a database, a flat file CMS typically relies on a combination of file names, header info, and templates to present pages and data.

###Reasons Why You Might Use A Flat File CMS, Grav specifically#
From my understanding, the benefits of a FFCMS include:
* **Speed:**
    With no need for calling information from databases, pages are loaded much quicker.
* **Ease of Setup:**
    Setting up Grav was as simple as downloading it, and extracting it to the root folder of my localhost.
    The file based nature of A FFCMS allows for easy backups of your entire site, literally just needing to copy the files. This is also useful if you are moving your site to a new hosting provider.
* **Simple content creation:** 
    For non coding users, new pages and posts can be created from gravs admin section. Otherwise it is as simple as creating a new folder with the relevant files within that folder (markdown file, images etc).

So for the above reasons, for my personal blog site, on which I want a light weight, simple setup that simply allows me to publish content, a FFCMS made sense. Keep it simple, no databases to worry about, easy setup (not without it's hiccups, I will cover these in future posts).

Out of the many FFCMS's that are available by now, I ended up choosing Grav because:
* It was free
* It seemed to have the biggest community available to call on for support when I ran in to issues.
* It's documentation seemed very comprehensive yet understandable to me.

I plan on posting about how I work with grav, how I got it setup, and more.
