##Getting To Hirafu#

After what felt like hundreds of goodbye-catch-ups, dinners and drinks over the last month, our departure date was finally here. 

===

We spent the night before our flight at Carla's parents, I was up every 40 minutes making sure we hadn't overslept, and that our passports and documents were all accounted for.

After a breezy run into the airport (mostly thanks to it being Cup Day in Melbourne), and a last goodbye with Carla's parents, and my family, we were through security and waiting at our gate, deciding whether or not we felt like eating anything due to the mixed feelings of hunger and nervous butterflies. After about an hour and a half of delays, we were finally up in the air. The feeling of leaving Australain ground, knowing I wont be back for over 7 months was pretty surreal, considering the longest Carla & I have been out of the country before is 2 weeks.

The flight to Tokyo was roughly 10 hours. The thought of having nothing to do but watch movies and chill our for 10 hours always sounds far more appealing then it actually turns out to be. I managed to fit in 3 movies:
* Baby Driver: Really fun movie with great chase scenes, and killer soundtrack
* Ghost In The Shell: Was ok, but I get the feeling they had to simplify / dumb it down to fit into the length of a movie, but I'm interested in seeing the Anime now.
* Hidden Figures: Nice movie about racism, NASA and the space race of the 60's.

Once touching down in Tokyo, we had to sort out our residency cards. We were hustled off into a room on the side of the customs area, while they looked over our papers and working visas, before printing off our residency cards without too much trouble. We made our way to a nearby hotel for the night, before the flight up to Sapporo the next day.

We arrived in Sapporo, collected our many bags, and were greeted by Adam, who drove us, as well as Lisa, one of Carla's fellow assistant managers, from the airport to our home for the next 4 months, Hirafu Village.

##Hirafu Village + Renient#
I was a little shocked when there was no snow to be found on the drive into Hirafu, as opposed to metres of snow on all sides of the roads on my last trip to Niseko. The day we arrived in Hirafu it was a barmy 15 degrees, and our driver explained that snow probably won't start coming down till a little closer to December, and that most of the business's in town aren't even open yet, a little concerning for me considering I don't actually start my job for another 2 weeks.

We got to our accommodation for the season, a lodge called [Renient](http://nbgdev.com.au/user/pages/images/renient-yotei.jpg). Renient is an older building, with a large living area, industrial kitchen, and about 8 or so rooms. Currently there are only 5 of us here, but once everyone else arrives we will have about 18 of us, so I'm definitely making the most of the peace and quiet while I can.

So far I've just been going for walks around the town, and getting some study done while all the others are at work.

##First Snowfall#
After being a little sad about the lack of snow when I first arrived, snow started falling yesterday afternoon. It was bitter sweet though as I had already promised to walk up to the offices of one of the properties to deliver Carla and my bond money for the accommodation, about a 30 min walk each way in the wind and rain/snow.

The snow continued to come down overnight, and we woke up to snow covering most of the ground in the town.

Anyway, I'm off to try lunch at Bombay Sizzler's, apparently they are doing 1000 yen ($~12 AUD) lunches for mountain staff for the rest of Nov.
